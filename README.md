# TikTok Discovery MCP

A Model Context Protocol service for TikTok video discovery and metadata extraction. This service provides a robust interface for searching TikTok videos by hashtags and retrieving trending content, with built-in anti-detection measures and error handling.

## Features

- Search videos by hashtags
- Configurable video count per search (default: 30)
- Anti-bot detection measures
- Proxy support
- Automatic API session management
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Health status monitoring

## Configuration

The service uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file with:

```env
ms_token=your_tiktok_ms_token  # Optional but recommended to avoid bot detection
TIKTOK_PROXY=your_proxy_url    # Optional proxy configuration
```

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Install browser automation dependencies
poetry run python -m playwright install

# Start the service
poetry run python -m tiktok_mcp_discovery.main
```

## Claude Desktop Integration

Once your service is running, you can integrate it with Claude Desktop. Since we're using Poetry for dependency management, make sure to run the MCP CLI commands through Poetry:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/tiktok-mcp-discovery

# Install the service in Claude Desktop with Poetry in editable mode
poetry run mcp install tiktok_mcp_discovery/main.py --with-editable . -f .env

# Optional: Install with a custom name
poetry run mcp install tiktok_mcp_discovery/main.py --name "TikTok Video Discovery" --with-editable . -f .env
```

After installation, the service will be available in Claude Desktop and will run using Poetry for proper dependency management.
